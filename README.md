# About Me

### Welcome to my HomeLab!

My name is Jonas and I have been the resident tech nerd at home and at work for much of the past decade.

I never had the opportunity or the need to publish or showoff any of my weird experimentation and learning onto the Internet before for three main reasons:

 **1.** I have never needed to create any support documentation.
 **2.** This hobby of mine only became serious recently due to layoffs everywhere.
 **3.** Testing, making, and breaking things is embarrassing sometimes.

I slowly realized after 3 years in sales and one CompTIA A+ certification later ***(finally)*** that most professionals in my field **rightly** told me that practical skills are more valued than cert-chasing. I personally felt that ten years of informal experience troubleshooting PC's, tinkering with software, and taking them apart shouldn't be for nothing.

So here I am, logging the journey to my first IT role by messing about, breaking things, buying replacements, then breaking them again and fixing code to the best of my abilities.

**Welcome to my playground**; *welcome to my HomeLab.*
